# deconstructing-political-echochambers-with-recommender-systems

This project envisions an architecture for a content based recommender system that combats political echo chambers and filter bubbles by exposing them to viewpoints across the political spectrum.
This engine would serve users content topically similar to content the user interacts with that comes from the opposing point of view. 

-----------------------------------------------

Recommender systems tend to create what social scientists and tech activists have dubbed 'filter bubbles' - online environments where content serving algorithms feed users content that conforms to their existing beliefs while shielding users from content they may disagree with.

Recommenders are creating environments where many people from different political and social groups can exist on the same planet but are living in different media worlds.

Many believe this is at least partly to blame for an increasingly ideologically polarized society.  Filter bubbles have extremely negative consequences for democratic societies. If people cannot understand eachother, if people cannot come together and agree on basic sets of facts, then we cannot collectively solve problems.
